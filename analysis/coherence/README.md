# Coherence Analyses (Figure 3)

This folder holds the coherence analyses. (Figure 3 analyses)

- `create_sig_theta_coherence_csv.Rmd`: This script creates a CSV file with the significant theta coherence values.
- `coherence_region_models.Rmd`: This script runs the coherence models for the different regions.
