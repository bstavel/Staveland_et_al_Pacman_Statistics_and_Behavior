This folder holds the Granger causality analyses. (Figure 4 analyses)

- `granger_lmes.Rmd`: This script runs the linear mixed effects models on the Granger causality results to determine directionality.
- `granger_plots.Rmd`: This script creates the plots for the directionality results.
- `granger_thresholds.Rmd`: This script tests the Granger causality results at different theta coherence thresholds.
