# Turnaround Time Correlation Analyses (Figure 4)

This folder holds the analyses of the correlation between turnaround time and theta/HFA syncrhony. (Figure 4 analyses)

- `brms_all_roi_model.Rmd`: This script runs the Bayesian models theta syncrhony across threshold.
- `brms_hfa_all_roi_model.Rmd`: This script runs the Bayesian models for HFA in all ROIs.
- `calculate_trial_correlations.Rmd`: This script calculates the trial-by-trial correlations.
- `Figure4_combinedhfa_theta_plots.Rmd`: This script creates the combined HFA and theta plots for Figure 4.
- `supp_table_turn_times.Rmd`: This script creates the supplementary table for the turnaround times.
- `turntime_threshold_model_comparison.Rmd`: This script compares the syncrhony results across different thresholds.
