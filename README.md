# Pacman Behavioral Analyses

## Overview

Analysis scripts (mostly in R) for the behavior and statistical analysis of the PacMan project. While [Staveland_et_al_Pacman_Neural_Analyses]([https://github.com/bstavel/pacman_ieeg](https://github.com/bstavel/Staveland_et_al_Pacman_Neural_Analyses)) has the python scripts for analyses that are (nearly) only brain data, these analyses include both pure behavioral analyses and both brain/behavior models.
