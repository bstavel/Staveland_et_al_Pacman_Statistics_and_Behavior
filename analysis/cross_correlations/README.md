# Cross-Correlation Analyses (Figure 4)

This folder holds the computation and statistical analysis of cross-correlations for the directionality analysis. (Figure 4 analyses)

- `compute_regional_ccfs_theta.Rmd`: This script computes the regional cross-correlations for theta.
- `theta_ccf_stats.Rmd`: This script runs the statistics on the theta cross-correlations.
